#### Just keeping a record of whats happening around your house wont save your house from a burglary, as it would let theft happen and then help police to catch them but instead if a system which alerts the surrounding about such threat could avoid such incident at first place. 

#### If our security cameras are made smart enough to detect the burglar and alert the people in surrounding by ringing the alarm. We can do this using Computer Vision, openCV library in python is very helpful for image processing. we need to break the video frame by frame and process those frames. If a security camera is installed at the gate or door then when an intruder enters the frame of the camera then the alarm should ring. This could be done by observing the difference between frames and if there is some disturbance observed then there is someone in the frame.
